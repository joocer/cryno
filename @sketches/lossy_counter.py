"""
Find the most frequent item in an infinite (i.e. larger than will fit in memory)
dataset.

This is a probabilistic algorithm, it saves memory and/or time to give you an
approximation of the correct answer. It doesn't claim to be 100% correct 100% of the
time.

This entirely new code but is based on LossyCounter by Manku and Motwani.

This works by dividing a bag into buckets, the number of times each item appears
in each bucket is used to removed rare items (items which have only appeared once)
