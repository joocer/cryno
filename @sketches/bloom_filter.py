Bloom Filter

This is a variation of the Bloom Filter; this provides a fast and memory efficient way
to tell if an item is in a list.

This is a probabilistic algorithm, it saves memory and/or time to give you an
approximation of the correct answer. It doesn't claim to be 100% correct 100% of the
time.

        Bloom Filters are a probabilistic approach to tracking items in a list.
        They use an array of booleans which are set according to hashes of the
        data items. Items are considered to be in the list if the booleans at
        the hashes are set, this results in a degree of false positives. This
        is factored into the calculation of the size of the boolean array and
        the number of hashes.

        This is used in the profiler to track unique string values without
        having to store the values or hashes of the values (minor errors
        with this count is not expected to be a problem)
